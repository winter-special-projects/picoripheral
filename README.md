# Picoripheral Suite
Suite of tools using the Raspberry Pi pico as a peripheral for strictly timed measurements - complementing the capability of the host Pi.

# Frequency Counter
Frequency counter (well, not really frequency, since measuring pulse lengths)
but records Âµs time spent in high, low. Simple implementation waits on high
on GPIO, then counts.
